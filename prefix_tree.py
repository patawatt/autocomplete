class SimplePrefixTree(Autocompleter):
    """A simple prefix tree.

    This class follows the implementation described on the assignment handout.
    Note that the attributes public as they will be accessed directly for testing purposes.

    === Attributes ===
    value:
        The value stored at the root of this prefix tree, or [] if this
        prefix tree is empty.
    weight:
        The weight of this prefix tree. If this tree is a leaf, this attribute
        stores the weight of the value stored in the leaf. If this tree is
        not a leaf and non-empty, this attribute stores the *aggregate weight*
        of the leaf weights in this tree.
    subtrees:
        A list of subtrees of this prefix tree.
    _weight_type:
        A str describing the method used to aggregate weights of nodes in
        the given tree.
    num_leaves:
        An int recording the number of leaves in the given tree. This saves time
        counting leaves using len() each time an average weight needs to be
        calculated.

    === Representation invariants ===
    - self.weight >= 0

    - (EMPTY TREE):
        If self.weight == 0, then self.value == [] and self.subtrees == [].
        This represents an empty simple prefix tree.
    - (LEAF):
        If self.subtrees == [] and self.weight > 0, this tree is a leaf.
        (self.value is a value that was inserted into this tree.)
    - (NON-EMPTY, NON-LEAF):
        If len(self.subtrees) > 0, then self.value is a list (*common prefix*),
        and self.weight > 0 (*aggregate weight*).

    - ("prefixes grow by 1")
      If len(self.subtrees) > 0, and subtree in self.subtrees, and subtree
      is non-empty and not a leaf, then

          subtree.value == self.value + [x], for some element x

    - self.subtrees does not contain any empty prefix trees.
    - self.subtrees is *sorted* in non-increasing order of their weights.
      (You can break ties any way you like.)
      Note that this applies to both leaves and non-leaf subtrees:
      both can appear in the same self.subtrees list, and both have a `weight`
      attribute.

class CompressedPrefixTree(SimplePrefixTree):
    """A compressed prefix tree implementation.

    While this class has the same public interface as SimplePrefixTree,
    (including the initializer!) this version follows the implementation
    described on Task 6 of the assignment handout, which reduces the number of
    tree objects used to store values in the tree.

    === Attributes ===
    value:
        The value stored at the root of this prefix tree, or [] if this
        prefix tree is empty.
    weight:
        The weight of this prefix tree. If this tree is a leaf, this attribute
        stores the weight of the value stored in the leaf. If this tree is
        not a leaf and non-empty, this attribute stores the *aggregate weight*
        of the leaf weights in this tree.
    subtrees:
        A list of subtrees of this prefix tree.

    === Representation invariants ===
    - self.weight >= 0

    - (EMPTY TREE):
        If self.weight == 0, then self.value == [] and self.subtrees == [].
        This represents an empty simple prefix tree.
    - (LEAF):
        If self.subtrees == [] and self.weight > 0, this tree is a leaf.
        (self.value is a value that was inserted into this tree.)
    - (NON-EMPTY, NON-LEAF):
        If len(self.subtrees) > 0, then self.value is a list (*common prefix*),
        and self.weight > 0 (*aggregate weight*).

    - This tree does not contain any compressible internal values.
      (See the assignment handout for a definition of "compressible".)

    - self.subtrees does not contain any empty prefix trees.
    - self.subtrees is *sorted* in non-increasing order of their weights.
      (You can break ties any way you like.)
      Note that this applies to both leaves and non-leaf subtrees:
      both can appear in the same self.subtrees list, and both have a `weight`
      attribute.
